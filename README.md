# Project-1---Browser-Based-Game

The game I have chosen for this project is Minesweeper. This is one of the first games I played as a kid, it will be a great challenge and great experience for me to build a replica. 

Minesweeper renders a table with multiple squares that may contain either a mine which ends the game, OR a number of the mines that could be in the area the player clicked on. The player must be careful not to click on a mine. If this is the case the game will be over. The player will win if they are able to click on all the squares that contain numbers only.
