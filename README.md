# Project-1---Browser-Based-Game

The game I have chosen for this projec this project is Minesweeper. This is one of the first games I played as a kid, it will be a great challenge and great experience for me to build a replica. 

Minesweeper renders a table with multiple squares that may contain either a mine which ends the game, OR a number of the mines that could be in the area the player clicked on. The player must be careful not to click on a mine. If this is the case the game will be over. The player will win if they are able to click on all the squares that contain numbers only.

Below is a preliminary drawing of that the game would potentially look like the image below. Further design is under review, foe example, the smiley and the mines may end up being of a different color.

The player must be able to do the following:
 Click on any square in the table 
 Be able to see if they clicked on a mine OR
 Be able to see a display of a number or group of numbers giving the player a hint of where the mines may be located
 Be able to see the time count
 Be able to see the smiley change it's facial expression so surprised everytime a square is clicked
 Be given the option to start new game upon wining or losing previous game

 Pseudo Code:

 //DOM style grid property 

 //Manipulate DOM to render game upon loading browser 

 //Create Math function for computer to set 5 mines randomly with numbers on the table 


 //Create an event listener to capture click of the player

 //Player will click on a square, a mine or a number will appear, if the square contains a mine the game will be over
 //If the square displays a number, player will have the change to click on another square
 
 //set timer of 5 minutes to allow the player to complete the game, if mine is hit. Timer will stop

 //Function to determine if player hit a mine or has another chance

 //Display the numbers that give the hint that a mine is close by (we could use 1 and 2 since the grid is 4x4)

 //Function to end game if player lost

 //Give player the option to play again or quit 

 Thank you
